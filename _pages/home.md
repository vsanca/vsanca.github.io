I am happy to announce that I joined Oracle at Redwood Shores as a Senior Member of Technical Staff on February 3! **(Website under re-construction, please find my latest research on Google Scholar and updates on Linkedin)**

I obtained my PhD from [Data-Intensive Applications and Systems (DIAS) lab](dias.epfl.ch) at [Doctoral School for Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/), advised by [Professor Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki?lang=en).

My thesis is on [Efficient Approximate Analytics via Adaptive Context-Conscious Query Processing](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/b8ce973a-6b95-403c-be17-c84331c41b77).

My research is in data management systems, specifically high-performance analytical systems on modern hardware, to enable workload-agnostic, timely, interactive, and cost-efficient insights offered by the growing amounts of data. With modern hardware and analytical methods, my interest is equally in the holistic optimization of model-relational hybrid analytics, approximate query processing, and optimizing data management systems for modern hardware platforms.

My goal and vision are to enable truly interactive analytics with zero assumptions about the workload by co-designing the algorithms to be efficient and utilize fully the underlying hardware, exploring the algorithmic bottlenecks, and developing systems and algorithms that maximize work reuse further to reduce the time-to-insight on high-bandwidth, low-latency analytical systems. Finally, the goal is to develop query processing systems that outperform the best and most highly optimized modern analytical engines, including ML model-driven analytics. 

To unlock this potential of modern analytics, I was working and developing my work on analytics on top of a high-performance heterogeneous engine [Proteus](https://www.proteusdb.com). Through holistic design and optimization, from query planning to hardware, we can enable cost and time-efficient insights by spending less (computational) time in the fastest layers of increasingly powerful computational hardware while using the latest analytical methods.

With the provenance of machine learning models enabling unstructured data analysis, making these methods part of an extended relational model and tightly integrated with optimization, execution, and data access is on my ongoing research agenda of **vector-relational data engine integration**. I summarize this in the statement that we need to go beyond vector indices only, and provide both performance and functionality for novel workloads and methods in a declarative an easy fashion for the user.

Outside my regular research and teaching activities, I am a committee member of [EPFL IC Ph.D. student association](https://epic.epfl.ch/), bringing together the faculty, alumni, industry, and student community to exchange ideas and experiences. This provides a doctoral-school level platform to get together and interact with distinguished faculty members more directly and informally and a forum for discussing challenges and opportunities in industry and organizations.

Outside the office, I enjoy traveling, hiking, singing, cooking, and improving my piano playing skills.
