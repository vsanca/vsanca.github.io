I am a Doctoral Candidate at [Data-Intensive Applications and Systems (DIAS) lab](dias.epfl.ch) at [Doctoral School for Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/), supervised by [professor Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki?lang=en). {: style="text-align: justify"}

My research is in the area of data management systems, focusing on using approximate query processing in conjunction with high-performance analytical systems on modern hardware to enable workload-agnostic, timely, interactive, energy- and cost-efficient insights offered by the growing amounts of data. {: style="text-align: justify"}

My goal and vision is to enable truly interactive analytics with zero assumptions about the workload, by co-designing the approximation algorithms to be efficient and utilize fully the underlying hardware, exploring the algorithmic bottlenecks, and developing systems and algorithms that maximize work reuse to further reduce the time-to-insight on high-bandwidth, low-latency analytical systems. Finally, the goal is to develop approximate query processing systems that outperform the best and highly-optimized modern analytical engines. To unlock this potential of modern analytics, I am working and developing my work on approximate analytics on top of a high-performance heterogeneous engine [Proteus](www.proteusdb.com). By harmonizing modern analytics with approximate algorithms, we can enable cost and energy efficient insights, by spending less (computational) time in the fastest layers of increasingly powerful computational hardware. {: style="text-align: justify"}

Outside my regular research and teaching activities, I am a committee member of [EPFL IC PhD student association](https://epic.epfl.ch/), especially interested in bringing together the faculty and student community through the Lunch Talks. This is a platform to exchange ideas, experience, and share the ups and downs about the life of a PhD student (and what awaits beyond). I found this especially important in the past couple of years, as it provided a doctoral-school level platform to get together and interact with distinguished faculty members in a more direct and informal way, and learning that we all face difficulties and insecurities which we can overcome together. {: style="text-align: justify"}

Outside of office, I enjoy travelling, hiking, singing, cooking, and improving my piano playing skills. {: style="text-align: justify"}
