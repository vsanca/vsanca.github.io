My research is in data management systems, machine learning, and applications. My primary focus is on using approximate query processing with high-performance analytical systems on modern hardware to enable workload-agnostic, timely, interactive, and cost-efficient insights from the growing amounts of data [5,7,8]. Broadly, I am interested in novel hardware architectures, hardware-software co-design, database systems, ML, and algorithms for analytics [2,6]. This also drives my interest in using machine learning with databases, particularly in mixed data format analytics and holistic optimization, from complex logical to physical plans that execute on heterogeneous hardware [2,3,6,8]. Finally, modern hardware requires special consideration to achieve the best performance; thus, analyzing and optimizing algorithms for modern platforms and systems remains a natural goal [1,4,5,6].
