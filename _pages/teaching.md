<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am a teaching assistant at EPFL. This is a fulfulling duty and responsability, as the end goal is always to transmit the enthusiasm of science while keeping academic rigor. {: style="text-align: justify"}

## 2022
### CS-322 Introduction to Database Systems, *spring, last semester course*
<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am the head TA for the course, assigned with creating and improving the teaching materials, exams, and infrastructure for 250 students.
This entails mentoring and guiding junior teaching assistants, and hiring student TAs besides other responsibilities. This year, we have went back to fully on-site mode of teaching, revamped the project, and transferred the examination to Moodle to allow streamlined grading with reduced contact. We have also kept the hybrid teaching mode - by reusing and improving the previously recorded materials to allow smoother transition to (mandated) fully in-person teaching. 
We have reached the milestone of 250 students this semester! </p>


## 2021
### CS-322 Introduction to Database Systems, *spring, last semester course*
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Head TA for the course, improved the online materials, and continued with regular course management duties. We have surpassed the 200 student milestone! Data management is becoming more popular among the sections! </p>

### CS-119d Information, Calcul, Computation, *fall, first semester course*
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Introduction to programming and computer science for maths and physics sections. This course is amazingly nice to teach, as it is both challenging and rewarding to find new ways to explain novel concepts in computer science to students who do not have a lot of background, focusing on good examples, practical demonstrations, and trying to motivate how their future work and studies could change (or be changed) by the computer science. </p>

## 2020
### CS-322 Introduction to Database Systems, *spring, last semester course*
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Head TA for the course, transferred the whole infrastructure and materials to new online platforms and Zoom in one week, allowing seamless continuation of teaching for the course. Despite the pandemic, the course was praised by the students for the clarity and organization, which was also reflected in the overall success of students that matched the pre-pandemic years. We had 128 students! </p>

### CS-119d Information, Calcul, Computation, *fall, first semester course*

### CS-726 Machine Learning for Database Systems, *fall, doctoral seminar course*
<p style='text-align: justify;'>I have initiated and co-designed the course with prof. Anastasia Ailamaki and prof. Christoph Koch, inspired by the breakthroughs of ML in systems (and systems for ML). We have organized a course that revolved around reading, writing-up, and discussing and presenting a selection of papers from the field, to improve the overall familiarity and understanding of the topic. </p>

## 2019
